Mirr synchronizes all your work for you. That means you can do dev stuff from your 
desktop and your laptop. Without having to move your work folder to dropbox or something.

You need to set a file or directory if you didn't already. This is because mirr 
won't have anything to sync if you didn't add anything. The most important thing 
to know is that there is always as master to mirror/sync/fetch from, or push to.

--------------------------------------------------

mirr add myfolder      :   Add 'myfolder' to sync list
mirr del somefile      :   Remove 'somefile' from sync list

mirr set time 10am     :   Set mirr to sync at 10 am everyday
mirr set every 02:45   :   Set mirr to sync every 2 hours, 45 minutes

mirr sync              :   Sync everything right now
mirr sync work.rb      :   Only Sync 'work.rb', nothing else changes
