# Mirr - Because you like synchronization

## What's this?

Mirr synchronizes directories of things for you, so you can 
work on the same thing, on different computers in your home.

## Installation

Almost as simple as mirr itself:

+ `sudo gem install mirr` Download & install via RubyGems

## Usage

## Contribute

New features are hard to think up by myself:

1. [Fork the project](https://github.com/wlib/mirr/fork)
2. Create your feature branch `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes `git commit -am 'I added an awesome feature'`
4. Push to the branch `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Create a new Pull Request on github
