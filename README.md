# Mirr - Because you like synchronization

## What's this?

Mirr synchronizes directories of things for you, so you can 
work on the same thing, on different computers in your home.

## Installation

Almost as simple as mirr itself:

+ `sudo gem install mirr` Download & install via RubyGems

## Usage

mirr add myfolder      :   Add 'myfolder' to sync list
mirr del somefile      :   Remove 'somefile' from sync list

mirr set time 10am     :   Set mirr to sync at 10 am everyday
mirr set every 02:45   :   Set mirr to sync every 2 hours, 45 minutes

mirr sync              :   Sync everything right now
mirr sync work.rb      :   Only Sync 'work.rb', nothing else changes
